# Challenges
# 1. Create a list of your favorite musicians.

fav_musicians = ['In Hearts Wake', 'Four Year Strong', 'Enter Shikari', 'Mom Jeans', 'Hot Mulligan']

print(fav_musicians)

# 2. Create a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the longitude and latitude of somewhere youâ€™ve lived or visited.

visitor = (['Croatia', '45.1000 N', '15.2000 E'], ['Italy', '41.8719', '12.5674'], ['Amsterdam', '52.3676', '4.9041'])

print(visitor)
print(visitor[2])

# 3. Create a dictionary that contains different attributes about you: height, favorite color, favorite author, etc.

details = {'height' : 173,
           'Colour' : 'Red',
           'Author' : 'J.R.R Tolkien'
           }

print(details)

# 4. Write a program that lets the user ask your height, favorite color, or favorite author, and returns the result from the dictionary 
# you created in the previous challenge.





# 5. Create a dictionary mapping your favorite musicians to a list of your favorite songs by them.
# 6. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are just a few of the containers built into Python. Research Python sets (a type of container). When would you use a set?
